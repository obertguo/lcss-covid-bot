# lcss-covid-bot
## Getting Started
* A Node JS environment is required 
* Entry point is index.js, so `node .` or `node index.js` will begin the code execution

## Notes
* A .env file is required inside the project's root directory as to store the discord bot's token. `TOKEN=BotTokenHere`.
* Google Chrome v87.xx is required for selenium webdriver to work (this corresponds with the chromedriver version used in ./utils). You can replace the chromedriver with a different version, and use a version of Chrome that corresponds accordingly

## Tests
* There are two designated test scripts â€” `npm run london` and `npm run ontario` 
* These begin the scraping execution and report back the data that is retrieved

## Dependencies 
* [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) (v87 is included in `./utils`)
* The following NPM dependencies 
```
